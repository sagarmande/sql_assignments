Scope: Temporary tables are created within a specific session or connection and exist until the session is closed. They are typically used for storing and manipulating intermediate results within a session.

Usage: Temporary tables are useful when you need to store and process a relatively large amount of data within a session. They are often used in complex queries, reporting, or when you need to break down a complex task into smaller, more manageable steps.

Syntax (SQL Server):


-- Create a temporary table
CREATE TABLE #TempTable (
    ID INT,
    Name NVARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert data into the temporary table
INSERT INTO #TempTable (ID, Name)
VALUES (1, 'John'), (2, 'Jane');



Cleanup: Temporary tables are automatically dropped when the session ends or when they are explicitly dropped using DROP TABLE #TempTable;.

Table Variable:

Scope: Table variables are local to the current batch, function, or stored procedure in which they are declared. They are not limited to a specific session and do not persist beyond the scope of the batch or procedure.

Usage: Table variables are suitable for storing and processing relatively small amounts of data within a specific scope. They are often used for encapsulating data and simplifying the query or procedure logic.

Syntax (SQL Server):



-- Declare a table variable
DECLARE @TableVariable TABLE (
    ID INT,
    Name NVARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert data into the table variable
INSERT INTO @TableVariable (ID, Name)
VALUES (1, 'John'), (2, 'Jane');
